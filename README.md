# Winery-Customer-Analysis
The project focused on analyzing a dataset containing customer, sales, and marketing information from Winery, covering over 65,000 orders between 2008 and 2010. The objective was to determine the most effective marketing channels—email subscriptions, newsletter subscriptions, and winemaker calls—and to identify high-potential customer segments to drive sales growth.

The proposed solution involved evaluating and refining advertising strategies through statistical modeling and customer segmentation. Logistic and linear regression models were applied to assess customer response patterns across different marketing channels, while a recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) analysis was conducted to classify and prioritize customer groups based on purchasing behavior.

Key findings revealed that email subscriptions were positively correlated with higher purchase frequency, while newsletter subscriptions were associated with a decline in average spending per order. Winemaker calls proved effective in converting casual visitors into higher-value customers, contributing to increased revenue per purchase. Additionally, offering discount coupons and promoting in-store purchases emerged as practical strategies to stimulate short-term sales growth.

Overall, the project provided actionable insights that enabled Winery to optimize marketing investments, tailor outreach to high-potential customers, and design more effective sales strategies to maximize long-term profitability.
